# EC2 Instance and EBS Volume Automation

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to launch an Amazon EC2 instance and attach an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume programmatically using the Boto3 library. The script utilizes the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following:

- An AWS account: You need an AWS account to access and utilize AWS services.

- Python and Boto3: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Boto3 is a Python library that provides an interface to AWS services. You can install Boto3 using pip, the Python package installer.

- AWS credentials: To authenticate and authorize your API requests, you need to provide your AWS access key and secret key. Ensure you have these credentials ready.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to launch an EC2 instance and attach an EBS volume programmatically:

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.

2. Open the script file  in a text editor.

3. Replace the placeholders `YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY` with your own AWS access key and secret key.

4. Optionally, modify the `region` variable to your preferred AWS region.

5. Customize the EC2 instance and EBS volume settings as needed. You can change the `ImageId` (AMI ID), `InstanceType`, `MinCount`, `MaxCount`, `AvailabilityZone`, `Size`, and `VolumeType` parameters to suit your requirements.

6. Save the changes to the script file.

7. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script file.

8. Run the script.

9. The script will launch an EC2 instance, wait for it to reach the running state, create an EBS volume, wait for the volume to become available, and finally attach the volume to the EC2 instance.

10. Once the script completes, you will see the output messages indicating the status of the EC2 instance and EBS volume.

Feel free to explore and customize the script further based on your specific needs.
